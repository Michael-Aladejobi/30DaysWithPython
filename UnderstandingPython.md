What is Python?—A Basic Definition
Python is a general-purpose coding language—which means that, unlike HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it can be used for other types of programming and software development besides web development.

Python can be used for things like:

Back end (or server-side) web and mobile app development
Desktop app and software development
Processing big data and performing mathematical computations
Writing system scripts (creating instructions that tell a computer system to “do” something)
But don’t let Python’s broad range scare you. Just like those more familiar-sounding languages, Python is an easy to learn, in-demand programming language that can exponentially increase your chances of getting hired and income in a matter of months.



Who is Python Good For?
Python is a rising star in the programming world for two main reasons: the big range of tasks it can handle, combined with the fact that it’s actually a very beginner-friendly language. Python code syntax uses English keywords, and that makes it easy for anyone to understand and get started with the language. For example, take a look at the code you’d use to print the text “Hello World” on your screen using the programming language Java:

Python Hello Word example

That’s a lot of code for such a simple function.

Now take a look at the same exercise written in Python code:

Print Hello World in Python

No question which one you’d rather work with, right? Still, as simple as Python’s syntax looks, it’s used for projects as complicated sounding as artificial intelligence and machine learning. That means Python is a great fit for a wide range of users, including:

Beginning coders
Web and mobile app developers
Software engineers
Data Scientists
AND anyone else working with or learning about computer programming!
